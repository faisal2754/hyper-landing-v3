01 — The Problem
Headline: Sound familiar?

Your data is everywhere except where you need it
Sales in Salesforce. Marketing in HubSpot. Finance in spreadsheets. Operations in custom tools. Getting a single view of your business means hours of manual work every week.

AI vendors keep asking for 'clean data' you don't have
You've heard the promise: AI will transform your business. But every vendor wants clean, unified data you don't have. Your AI projects stall before they start.

Enterprise tools want enterprise budgets
You got the Snowflake + Fivetran quote. R50K/month before you've moved a single row. These tools are built for companies with data teams — not companies that need one.

Transition: You're not alone. Most mid-market companies hit this wall. You need real data infrastructure — without hiring a data team to run it.

02 — The Solution
Headline: Two products. One data foundation.

Subheadline: HyprFlow and HyprStore work together to consolidate your data, make it analytics-ready, and power the dashboards and AI tools that drive growth.

HyprFlow — Connect & Sync
Tagline: Your data, always in sync

HyprFlow connects to your existing tools — CRMs, ERPs, spreadsheets, databases, APIs — and keeps everything syncing reliably. No more manual exports. No more broken pipelines.

Capabilities:

200+ pre-built connectors — Salesforce, HubSpot, QuickBooks, Google Sheets, and more
Real-time & scheduled syncs — Data arrives when you need it
Automatic error handling — Pipelines self-heal; you get alerts, not emergencies
Custom transformations — Clean, deduplicate, and reshape data automatically
Best for: Companies with existing databases or tools who need reliable automated data movement

HyprStore — Store & Analyze
Tagline: A data warehouse that's actually ready to use

HyprStore is a fully managed data warehouse designed for analytics, not transactions. We handle the architecture, hosting, backups, and optimization — you get fast queries and reliable reporting.

Capabilities:

Professional data architecture — Star schemas designed for your business
Petabyte scale — Grows with you, no migration required
Query optimization — Fast dashboards, not spinning wheels
Zero maintenance — We handle backups, security, and updates
Best for: Companies building dashboards, reports, or AI capabilities who need a proper data foundation

Combined Note
Flow: Sources → HyprFlow → HyprStore → Outputs

Here's the truth: most companies need both. HyprFlow moves the data; HyprStore makes it queryable. Together, they're the foundation for dashboards, reports, and AI.

03 — Add-Ons
Headline: Ready for more? Add analytics and AI.

Subheadline: Once your data foundation is in place, unlock powerful insights with our add-on products.

HyprLens — See Your Data Clearly
Dashboards your team will actually use. We build them in your preferred tool — Power BI, Tableau, or Looker — and train your team to get value from day one.

CTA: Learn about HyprLens

HyprMind — AI That Knows Your Business
Ask questions in plain English. Get anomaly alerts before problems become crises. HyprMind is like having a data analyst who never takes vacation — and knows every number in your business.

What HyprMind can do:

What drove the revenue spike last Tuesday?
Alert me when customer churn exceeds 5%
Compare Q3 performance across all regions
CTA: See HyprMind in action

04 — How It Works
Headline: A clear path from kickoff to go-live

Subheadline: No surprises. No scope creep. Just results.

Discovery — Week 1
Map your data landscape

We dig into your systems, interview your team, and map every data source. By the end of week one, you'll have a complete blueprint — and a fixed price.

Deliverable: Solution architecture diagram and project plan

Build — Weeks 2-4
Build your infrastructure

Our engineers get to work. We build your pipelines, design your warehouse, and set up monitoring. You'll get weekly updates — not requests for more budget.

Deliverable: Working data infrastructure in your environment

Validate — Week 5
Test everything together

Your team tests everything. Run queries. Build a report. If the numbers don't match, we fix it. We don't go live until you're confident.

Deliverable: Fully tested, production-ready system

Operate — Ongoing
Go live with confidence

We monitor everything 24/7. When something breaks, we fix it — usually before you notice. Need a new data source? We'll add it. That's what managed means.

Deliverable: Managed service with engineering support

05 — Industries
Headline: See how companies like yours use Hypr

Subheadline: We've helped companies across industries unlock the value in their data. Here's how teams like yours use HyprFlow and HyprStore.

Retail & E-commerce — Finally see all your sales in one place
Challenge: You receive sales data in 12 different formats from distributors, marketplaces, and POS systems. Reconciling inventory takes days. Demand forecasting is guesswork.

Solution: HyprFlow automatically ingests data from all channels — Shopify, Amazon, EDI feeds, distributor portals. HyprStore unifies it into a single view for inventory optimization and sales analytics.

Results:

80% reduction in manual data reconciliation
Real-time inventory visibility across all channels
Accurate demand forecasting with 3-week lookahead
Financial Services — Pass your next audit without the panic
Challenge: Regulators want to know where your numbers come from. Your current systems can't trace data from source to report. Audit season is a nightmare.

Solution: HyprFlow maintains complete audit trails for every data movement. HyprStore provides the governance layer financial services require — with SOC 2 compliance and role-based access controls.

Results:

Audit preparation reduced from weeks to days
Complete data lineage for regulatory reporting
Secure, compliant data infrastructure
Healthcare & Life Sciences — Connect clinical and operations without compromising security
Challenge: Research data lives in silos. Operational metrics are in spreadsheets. Getting insights means manual work that delays critical decisions.

Solution: HyprFlow connects clinical systems, research databases, and operational tools while maintaining strict security controls. HyprStore provides HIPAA-compliant storage optimized for analytical queries.

Results:

Unified view of clinical and operational data
HIPAA-compliant data infrastructure
Research insights delivered in hours, not weeks
AI & Analytics Enablement — Stop your AI projects from stalling
Challenge: Your AI vendor says you need "clean, unified data." Your data scientists spend 80% of their time finding and preparing data. Models never make it to production.

Solution: HyprFlow and HyprStore create the data foundation that makes AI possible. Clean, deduplicated, properly structured data — ready for machine learning, predictive models, and LLM applications.

Results:

Data scientist time on prep reduced by 70%
First ML model to production in 6 weeks
Foundation for chatbots, predictions, and recommendations

Best for Mid-market companies Enterprise with data teams Tech companies with resources
Here's what it comes down to
Fivetran and Snowflake are great — if you have a data team to run them. Most mid-market companies don't. That's not a weakness; it's just a different stage of growth. We built Hypr for companies who need enterprise results without enterprise overhead.

Hypr gives you the same capabilities, delivered as a fully managed service with fixed monthly pricing. You get enterprise-grade infrastructure without hiring a data team.

Testimonials
"Before Hypr, our marketing team spent two days every week pulling data from six different platforms into spreadsheets. Now it's automated. We've reallocated that time to actually analyzing the data and optimizing campaigns. The ROI was obvious within the first month."

— Ricky M., CMO, 3Way Marketing Marketing team reclaimed 16+ hours per week

"We evaluated Snowflake and Fivetran, but the costs were unpredictable and we didn't have data engineers to manage it. Hypr gave us the same capabilities at a third of the cost with none of the overhead."

— Sarah K., Head of Operations, FinServe Co

"Our AI chatbot project was stalled for six months because we couldn't get clean data. Hypr had us up and running in four weeks. The chatbot is now handling 40% of our customer inquiries."

— Michael T., CTO, TechStart

10 — FAQ
Headline: Frequently asked questions

How long does implementation take? 4-6 weeks for most projects. Complex setups might take 8-12 weeks. We'll give you a fixed timeline — and stick to it.

Do we need a data engineer on our team? No. That's the whole point. We handle the pipelines, the warehouse, the monitoring — all of it. You focus on using the data.

What if we already have some data infrastructure? Great — we work with what you have. If you're already using a cloud database or have some pipelines in place, we can integrate with your existing setup rather than replacing everything.

How does pricing work? Are there hidden costs? Our pricing is fixed monthly. No usage-based surprises. We quote a specific monthly fee during discovery, and that's what you pay. The only thing that changes your price is adding new data sources or capabilities — and we'll quote those upfront too.

What happens if something breaks? Our monitoring catches most issues before you notice them. When something does need attention, you have direct access to our engineering team — not a ticket queue. Response times are defined in your SLA, typically under 4 hours for critical issues.

Can we add AI capabilities later? Absolutely. HyprFlow and HyprStore create the data foundation that makes AI possible. When you're ready for natural language queries, predictive models, or chatbots, HyprMind plugs directly into your existing infrastructure.

What data sources do you support? We have 200+ pre-built connectors covering most common business tools — CRMs, ERPs, marketing platforms, databases, spreadsheets, and APIs. If you have a niche system we haven't connected before, we can build a custom connector.

Is our data secure? Yes. We're SOC 2 Type II certified, GDPR compliant, and HIPAA ready. Your data is encrypted in transit and at rest, access is controlled and logged, and you choose where your data is stored geographically.
